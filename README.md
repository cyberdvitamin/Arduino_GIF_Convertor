Easy to use application for splitting the frames from a "GIF" file or just a simple picture. 

Application:
 - Creating multiple frames for your Arduino project display (128x64).
 - Displaying "GIF" files and images easily.
 - Simple and intuitive to use!

User instructions:
1. Open the folder "dist".

3. Here you can find ".idea", "display_gif" and "main.exe". We are going to use "main.exe" so double click on that.

5. We are being presented with a simple to use UI (user interface). Here we can find the option to select a "GIF" using the button "Browse" that will let you access files in your computer.

7. After selecting the "GIF" or the image you are being presented with new information of the splitting. You will see the numbers of frames that it will be split into and a recommended frame delay.

9. Here you can select to use the recommended frame delay or just change it how you like!

11. You are also able to pick the rotation angle (in degrees) that you want your file to be rotated to. Don't worry, if you don't want to be rotation your file you can just not change anything in there.

13. After you've made all the choices you wanted press on the "Convert" button.

15. It is going to give you the information if the conversion was completed or not and the header file location (it will be created in a folder called "display_gif" and it will be called "frames.h".

17. Here the conversion is done, but if you want you can use the file that is already created for the Arduino to display the frames created.

![display_gif_dir](https://github.com/cyberdvitamin/Arduino_GIF_Convertor/assets/91136019/b962c39d-b49b-4ea5-adb0-885739c1da9b)

19. The Arduino file is located in the "display_gif". Make sure you have "frames.h" (the one you have converted to) and the Arduino file in the same directory called "display_gif"!
